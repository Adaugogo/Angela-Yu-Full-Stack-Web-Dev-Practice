<h1>My Favourite Series of all Time</h1>
<h2>According to the Gospel of Adaugogo</h2>
<hr />
<h3>F.R.I.E.N.D.S</h3>
<p>
  This was a beautiful sitcom about navigating adult friendships and
  relationships generally. So precious
</p>
<h3>YOU</h3>
<p>I think this gave me the best and psychotic twists.</p>
<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>They had us rooting for theives. The writers outdid themselves</p>
